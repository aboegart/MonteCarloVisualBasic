# MonteCarloMacro
Monte Carlo Simulation in visual basic.

The excel sheet contains the macro needed to calculate outputs. 
Go to Developer tab and hit macro and then run.
If Developer tab is not available, go to View and look for macro option and run.
The macro reads the data (min-max array and percentage) from "Sheet1" and performs the simulation.

The python application calculates following data: Input:
1. Two dimensional array with minimum and maximum range.
2. Percentage.

Output:
1. Standard Deviation.
2. Error.
3. Number of random arrays.
4. Average of random arrays.
